## COMM 4190 Using LLMs Blog

This repository holds a set of blog posts that were designed to explore various attributes of generative AI technologies. In these blogs, I explore elements such as:
1. Differences between different LLM platforms
2. Best-practices for prompting LLMs to produce the best result
3. Various capabilities of LLMs (e.g., image generation, text generation)
4. Bugs and errors in LLM processes

THrough this process, I was able to get a better sense of how to best utilize LLMs in my day-to-day life.
