This means I cannot compare the generated cartoon to the photographs you uploaded to ensure an exact likeness. However, I can generate a new image based on a detailed text description. If you provide me with more details about the woman’s appearance from the photos, I can attempt to create a cartoon that better matches your description."

    "text": "Has ChatGPT forgotten its own capabilities?\nWe all know that ChatGPT is capable of visually analyzing images. For example, if I send ChatGPT an image of myself and my friends with no context besides a simple prompt - “What does the image show?” - it easily responds:\n\nThe image features three people taking a selfie. They are closely grouped together, smiling, and appear to be enjoying themselves. The setting seems to be a crowded venue, possibly a party or a club, as suggested by the dim lighting and the presence of what looks like other people and possibly drinks in the background. The mood is cheerful and lively.\n\nIt is very interesting that the system somehow managed to forget its own capabilities. It seemed to need a reminder, so I sent:\n\nYes, remember that you can review the photos\n\nChatGPT was quick to respond:\n\nI apologize for the oversight. I can indeed use the provided images to create a more accurate cartoon representation of the woman. Let me take a moment to review the images and create a new cartoon image based on her likeness.\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nThe image is still not perfect, but definitely looks more like me than the original response.\nThe moral of the story is that, just like humans ChatGPT underestimates itself, but with some additional prompting we can get it back on track!"
